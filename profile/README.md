## 🧠 Overview

**FxSound** is a modern audio enhancement application designed to improve sound clarity, depth, and balance on Windows devices. It processes audio in real time, allowing users to experience richer playback across headphones, speakers, and external audio systems.

This makes it suitable for music, movies, games, and online content.

FxSound features a clean and responsive interface that allows users to fine-tune audio profiles quickly. Whether you prefer subtle improvements or a more dynamic sound signature, the application provides precise controls to match different listening environments and personal preferences.
